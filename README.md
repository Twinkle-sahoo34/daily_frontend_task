# Daily Frontend Tasks Project

This project is a React-based frontend application designed to practice JSX, props, routing, and building reusable components. Each day introduces a new UI task, allowing developers to enhance their React skills step by step.

## Features

- **Reusable Card Component**: Pass `name`, `college`, and `year` as props to create multiple cards dynamically.
- **Routing**: Navigate between different "Day" pages using React Router / Next.js routing.
- **Responsive Design**: Cards and UI components adapt to different screen sizes.
- **Interactive Buttons**: Navigate to different pages with styled buttons.

## How to Use

--Click on the buttons on the home page to navigate to different day tasks.
--Add more cards by passing new props to the Card component.
-- Style and customize buttons or cards as needed.

## Technologies Used

* React / Next.js
* TypeScript
* Tailwind CSS (for styling)
* JSX & Props
* Responsive Web Design

## Future Improvements
-- Add more interactive components for each day.
--Integrate API calls to fetch card data dynamically.
--Implement dark/light mode toggle.
